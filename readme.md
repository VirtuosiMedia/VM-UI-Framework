VM UI Framework
=====

The idea behind VM UI Framework is simple: "Use for any app. Build for any screen."

With that goal in mind, here are some of the major features of the project:

- **100% responsive** - Every single interface element will scale up or down as needed.
- **Grid-based layouts** - Use the flexibility of the grid to create beautiful pages.
- **Vertical pacing** - A baseline height is used to keep every element vertically aligned.
- **JavaScript plugins** - With 20+ JavaScript plugins and counting, most of your common interface elements are covered.
- **Swappable Templates** - Use the same markup with different templates. There are 3 interchangable templates out of the box. 
- **Easy-to-use** - Semantic class names make markup easy to remember. Advanced JavaScript knowledge is not required.
- **Well-documented** - Extensive documentation and examples mean you won't ever have to wonder how to do something.

We're in beta

There are still some bugs to be worked out, so hold off using VM UI Framework in production for a little while longer.
