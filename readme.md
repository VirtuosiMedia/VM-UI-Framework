VM UI Framework
=====

A modern, grid-based CSS, layout, and UI framwork for HTML5, VM UI Framework was created to assist in 
creating websites and, more specifically, web applications. It's a companion to VM PHP Framework, but 
can be used independently as well. It's inspired by Twitter's Bootstrap framework, but we wanted to 
take it in a slightly different direction.
